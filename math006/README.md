## Problem 6 

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

## Part A

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

answer()

## Part B

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the consecutive natural numbers starting with and p and ending at q and the square of the sum of consecutive natural numbers starting with p and q.
